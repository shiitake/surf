surf - simple webkit-based browser
==================================
surf is a simple Web browser based on WebKit/GTK+.

This is my fork of surf - that I'm running on my debian box.  

Debian specific dependencies: 
* libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
* libgcr-3-dev

Patches that I've installed:
* I've update the config to use XDG Base Directory spec



Requirements
------------
In order to build surf you need GTK+ and Webkit/GTK+ header files.

In order to use the functionality of the url-bar, also install dmenu[0].

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (surf is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install surf (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running surf
------------
run
	surf [URI]

See the manpage for further options.

Running surf in tabbed
----------------------
For running surf in tabbed[1] there is a script included in the distribution,
which is run like this:

	surf-open.sh [URI]

Further invocations of the script will run surf with the specified URI in this
instance of tabbed.
